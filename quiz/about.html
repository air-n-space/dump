            This project is born out of two defining experiences: a female existence within a highly commercialized and digital world, and a long-held desire to understand and map one-self. This website plays upon the structure of a specific marketing tool called shoppable quizzes–used by many beauty and “wellness” brands to sell female-targeted audiences customized products aimed at making them feel more soft, shiny, beautiful, and adequate. 
        <br><br>
        This blend of a "shoppable" quiz and a personality quiz calls into question the many ways we fragment ourselves in order to be more palatable to the institutions and individuals around us; it calls into question the many ways we market and brand ourselves to become consumable products in a capitalist world. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The questions generated for the quiz are adapted from the New York Times article <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html">“The 36 Questions That Lead to Love,"</a> while the multiple choice responses are based upon the different roles I often find myself playing in my life. As the user engages with the quiz, they find that it often breaks, loops back to the beginning, leads to nonsensical answers, and very rarely brings them to the “intended” result. This quiz hopes to draw attention to the fact that despite capitalism’s best efforts, it is impossible to clearly and succinctly map ourselves into easily-marketable or marketed-to categories. 
        <br><br>
        We are more than the roles we play. 
        <br>

        We are more than the products we consume. 
        <br>
        We are more than the data we produce. 
        <br><br>
        We are made up of many many different fragments of self, complexly intertwined and folded together to form our unique human existence.
