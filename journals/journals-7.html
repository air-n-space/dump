        <h1>The Poetry of Tools: Form Art by Alexei Shulgin</h1>

            <h2>I’m taking a special look at Form Art by Alexei Shulgin, which is a web art piece made back in 1997.</h2>
            <h3>I’m especially interested in this piece because of the date of its creation–it's pretty old at this point.</h3>
            <h4>Seeing things that were made on the web that are around 25 years old and still function is so alluring to me. </h4>
            <h5>While we often think the internet is forever, so many websites, platforms, languages, etc get old, are no longer supported in some fashion, and cease to exist.</h5>
            <h6>Things on the internet are far from immortal; sometimes it feels as if the tactile is what really lasts forever, even if it’s just buried in some box in your basement.</h6>
            <p>Despite all this, Form Art still exists and functions, and I think this is due to the tools of its creation–HTML. </p>
            <h6>While there are a number of new languages that continue to shape the landscape of the web, HTML remains relative as the primary scaffolding of websites. </h6>
            <h5>The importance of HTML goes beyond ensuring this site will work for years to come: it quite literally uses the built in styling and structuring that HTML provides to create something exciting and visually pleasing. </h5>
            <h4>HTML is the art in this piece, not just something used in the background to display the art. </h4>
            <h3>This feels really significant to me, especially in a class like Handmade Web that is trying to get us to re-examine what we think a website is and what a website can be.</h3>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Art Form also reminds me of how I was first using HTML when we first were introduced to the language.</h2>
            <h1> I didn’t know how to style or build out anything using divs, spans, ids, or class in conjunction with CSS, so I relied on pure HTML tags that came with their own styling and structure.</h1>
            <h2>This is especially evident in my first journal entry or so; I wanted to create something that was more than a block of text with the little resources I had. </h2>
            <h3>Art Form almost seems like a commentary on access to resources or technology as well.</h3>
            <h4>While not rich in fancy javascript or CSS styling, this bare-boned site still is visually appealing and interactive for the user.</h4>
            <h5> It’s a minimalist approach that–now with more knowledge on how the web works–I can deeply appreciate. 
            </h5>
