            It’s a slow morning with a homemade breakfast. We go on a walk around the neighborhood with the dog. Afterwards Monica bakes cookies and we put a movie on in the background. Mom cooks a homemade dinner and we play a game together over a glass of wine. The fire crackles in the background, and everything feels okay. I am seen and heard.

            Emma yells down the hall, and we all pile into her car to head to brunch. We sit over hashbrowns and coffee to debrief the night before. Later that afternoon we lay out at the river, drinks in hand and listen to peach pit. The sun struggles to set but it finally does late in the day and we end the night by sitting outside on the back deck talking shit and laughing.

            We begin the day skin against skin and whispers of sweet nothings in each other’s ears until one of us can’t take it anymore: the ice breaks and the room grows hot. Afterwards, you pick out my outfit  and we go get coffee, slowly walking, hand in hand, and pointing at the houses we hope to live in together one day. We discover a bookstore along the way, and you give me book recommendations. The day is meandering and slow, and your eyes shine brightly when they gaze over at me. We go to dinner and share a bottle of wine and everything is delicious and silly and the most wonderful it possibly could be. We are in love.

            I get up early, feed the cat, make a cup of coffee, and write in my journal. After I make my to-do list and schedule for the day, I turn on some music and get to work. I hit a good groove and get a lot done–checking everything off my list and ending the day feeling satisfied.

            I let myself sleep in a little and wake up feeling refreshed. I go on a run by the river, listen to my podcast, and tell myself that this is me healing. After a quick shower, I clean up my room and get ready for the day while watching a youtube video. The weather shines warmly in my skin as I run errands by myself and listen to music. I cook an early dinner with lots of vegetables and eat outside on the back deck while reading. I watch a documentary until I fall asleep.
