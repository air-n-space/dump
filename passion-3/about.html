        <h3><u>about toast:</u></h3>
        <p>“Toast is sliced bread that has been browned by radiant heat. The browning is the result of a Maillard reaction altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer. The firm surface is easier to spread toppings on and the warmth can help butter reach its melting point. Toasting is a common method of making stale bread more palatable. Bread is toasted using a toaster or a toaster oven. Toast may contain carcinogens (acrylamide) caused by the browning process.</p>
            <p>Butter or margarine, and sweet toppings, such as jam or jelly, are commonly spread on toast. Regionally, savory spreads, such as peanut butter or yeast extract, may also be popular. Toast may accompany savory dishes such as soups or stews, or it can be topped with ingredients like eggs or baked beans to make a light meal. Toast is a common breakfast food. A sandwich may also use toasted bread.” </p>

        <h3><u>about peanut butter:</u></h3>
        <p>“Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground, dry-roasted peanuts. It commonly contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Peanut butter is consumed in many countries. The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter and one of the largest consumers of peanut butter annually per capita.[2] January 24 is National Peanut Butter Day in the United States.[3]</p>
            <p>Peanut butter is a nutrient-rich food containing high levels of protein, several vitamins, and dietary minerals. It is typically served as a spread on bread, toast, or crackers, and used to make sandwiches (notably the peanut butter and jelly sandwich). It is also used in a number of breakfast dishes and desserts, such as granola, smoothies, crepes, cookies, brownies, or croissants. It is similar to other nut butters such as cashew butter and almond butter.”</p>

        <h1>if peanut butter toast is the passion, then i am the writer...</h1>
        <p>people ask me what my favorite food is, and i flounder. my idea of food has been skewed for years; how can one exist as my favorite, when i’ve tried my very best to keep a liking for food at an arm’s length for so long?
        </p>
        <p>i offer an alternative to my favorite food, and that is a food that brings me comfort: peanut butter toast. why have i eaten it almost every morning since the age of fifteen? long story, but ultimately because it offers me comfort and ease. the routine of making is intimately familiar and stupid easy. breakfast is the most important meal of the day so i’m told. peanut butter toast is the most important meal of the day for ever and ever. amen.  
        </p>
        <p>this passion site exists as a way to unpack my feelings around this fixation i have on peanut toast. it’s also an excuse to let myself write without fear; i never felt like much of a writer until a couple of months ago. not that all the sudden i’m a wRitEr, but within the digital walls of this site, i’m letting myself try that identity on–even if just for fun or in the privacy of my bedroom.
