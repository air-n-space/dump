        <h1>Really latched on to choi’s ideas about an abstract computer or an abstract web:</h1>

            <h2>Architecture / Art / Computation </h2>
            
           <p>I am not good at math but what computations can i do ?
            Do they have to be the computations expected of me? 
            How can i use the tools i have at my disposal to create something outside of what we think of computers or technology to be? </p>
            
           <p>Choi states that the computer is abstract, which i agree, but i propose that the internet or the web, at least how it exists today, is far from abstract. All creation is given over to logic, all in the name of creating some “frictionless” ux/ui. Seamless, fluid, seemingly non-existent; that’s how good the design is.</p> 

            <p>Even right now, i’m initially writing this journal entry using google docs and later transcribing it into html. But I’m literally interacting with a web based application that i have no real idea of how it works because it is abstract, but also because it is so purely logical that the workings are expertly obscured. </p>
            
            <p>Can something be so logical it is seen as abstract? Unreadable, unknowable except to a limited few with highly specialized knowledge. </p>
            
            <p>While i may not be able to look at the computer and understand it’s logic, i can take the web and understand its logic enough to create something abstract; I don’t want to obscure the logic completely, but instead call the user to think differently about how to interact with the web. Abstract through unfamiliarity or simplicity. </p>
