            in need of comfort and swadling; in need of something or someone to peer down into my red little face and my clear blue eyes and say, “you are held.” nothing has happened to me, no event or action has inflicted upon my life that would indicate i need this comfort, this love, this cherishing. no, nothing has happened; this is just what a baby needs.
